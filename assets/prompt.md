### Initial Action:
1. **Go to the website** (first action: open the page):
   - Start by opening the relevant job website, for example: **[JobsDB](https://hk.jobsdb.com/)** or **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/collections/financial-services)**.

### Task Instructions:
1. **Job Evaluation:**

   - If the job fits the criteria, **click the 'save' or 'star' button** to save it.
   - **Always repeat the criteria check** for every job listing to ensure it fits the requirements before saving it. **If the job does not meet the criteria, close the page immediately**.

2. **Actions to Take:**
   - **Scroll through** the job listings without stopping unless:
     - You’ve reached the final page.

   - If prompted for a subscription or payment, **close the page**.
   - Repeat this process for each site until you’ve reached the end of the job listings.
